# Footprinting

*Finding useful information about the target on the Internet (also known as footprinting) is an important penetration testing step, and it is a critical part of the overall process that provides data to be used in subsequent strategies. It can provide information that can help formulate subsequent attacks, and in terms of an ICS penetration test, it can sometimes yield information that might give clues as to how the process environment functions and what systems are used.
The skills required and the techniques used in ICS footprinting are no different than for any other penetration test and include researching company information and discovering IP address blocks and URLs associated with the target. There are a few tools and methods worth mentioning here, however, that often prove to be particularly fruitful with regard to ICS penetration testing:*

  * **Discover Scripts**   (https://github.com/leebaird/discover) automates much of the OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) legwork that is usually done manually. It checks the whois information, looks for subdomains and hosts, harvests names and email addresses, cross-references information with social media, and much more, all in a single script. It’s important to remember to only run the passive recon scripts. Active scripts could pose a threat to production environments.
  * **Google hacking databases** (there are several—try Googling it) and performing manual Google hacking (now known as Google dorking), as described in Google Hacking for Penetration Testers, Third Edition, by Johnny Long, Bill Gardner, and Justin Long (Syngress, 2015), helps you find URLs, files, and any other information that could provide clues or even access to the ICSs (or to an adjacent network).
  * **Maltego** (https://www.paterva.com/web6/products/maltego.php) automates many of the tasks associated with footprinting. Given an initial starting point such as an IP address or email address, Maltego will scour the Internet (including websites, forums, social media, Twitter posts, and so on) for anything and everything associated with that initial perimeter. Just like Google hacking, the goal is to find information that could give further clues about network architecture and/or data to be used for social engineering.
  * **Shodan** (https://www.shodan.io/) is one of the most surprising and often shocking Internet tools. Shodan is a specialized online search engine designed to find Internet-facing devices. It can also be used to find Internet-facing ICS devices. This may sound unheard of to some people in the industry, but it’s amazing how many Internet-facing ICS devices there actually are. Project SHINE (http://www.securityweek.com/project-shine-reveals-magnitude-internet-connected-critical-control-systems) revealed more than 1,000,000 (yes, as in 1 million, it’s not a typo) Internet-facing ICS devices. As a side note, Shodan can also be used as an ongoing defensive tool. I have clients that set up scheduled monitoring of the Shodan API to catch any of their ICS devices that might show up.
