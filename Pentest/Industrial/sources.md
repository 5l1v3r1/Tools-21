# Sources and resources

## External Threat Intelligence Sources

  * ICS-CERT   (https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/) DHS ICS-CERT has long been regarded as a definitive source for ICS threat intelligence, including vulnerability advisories, quarterly reports, and more, available as a public resource as well as a vetted private portal.
  Critical Intelligence   (http://www.critical-intelligence.com/) Recently acquired by iSight Partners (who was, in turn, just purchased by FireEye), Critical Intelligence was the first private company to provide ICS-specific threat intelligence.
  
  * Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC)   These often sector-specific (for example, E-ISAC, ONG-ISAC, ICS-ISAC) information-sharing centers can be an alternative or augmentation to ICS-CERT, and can be more cost effective than personalized commercial services. The value of these centers is, however, highly dependent upon the active participation of their members. There is very little, if any, motivation for members to share their own incidents, so the centers often seek more information than they are willing to give. That said, these centers have great promise (just as the financial sector has done with their FS-ISAC) as long as the members can collectively come to a consensus and improve sharing.
  
  * Infragard   (https://www.infragard.org/) Infragard is a partnership between the FBI and the private sector. It offers a strictly vetted and private membership forum where threat intelligence of a more sensitive nature can be shared and where it would not otherwise be available to the general public.
  
  * SCADAHacker.com   (https://www.scadahacker.com) While not a threat intelligence service, it is worth mentioning that Joel Langill has created a rather comprehensive ICS security-specific resource repository. At the time of this writing, the website is well maintained and kept up to date with an information collection regarding the latest ICS vulnerabilities, threats, and more.
  
  * Recorded Future   (https://www.recordedfuture.com/ics-scada/) A varying selection of threat intelligence platforms are available, many of which are developed by threat intelligence services companies. Recorded Future tends to distinguish itself by often being used as the basis for other threat intelligence platforms and services. It is also making a significant entry into the ICS market.
