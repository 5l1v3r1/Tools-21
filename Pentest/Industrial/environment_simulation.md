# ICS Lab - Tips for setting up 

A set of tools and recommendations used to create an ICS replica used for tests and for audit!

*The bottom line is that ICS devices (legacy and modern alike) don’t typically play well with “foreign” traffic, and legacy operating systems are what they are. The life of many legacy PLCs is upward of 20 to 30 years. Common active penetration-testing techniques, vulnerability scanners, and even simple network scanning tools like Nmap can cause the issues discussed here. If you are concerned about the availability of your production network, then all active scanning and testing should be performed in a test and development lab.*

## 1. vCenter Converter

*Replicating production control devices in the lab should be relatively straightforward. For example, grab a spare PLC of the same model as the one in production, program it, and plug it in. Okay, that’s simplified quite a bit, but you get the point. Where things begin to get complicated is when you have to replicate engineering workstations, HMIs, historians, SCADA servers, and so on.* The easiest way to replicate machines with special software is by using **vCenter Converter**, **that allows you to convert a live physical machine into a virtual machine without shutting down the host**. *(This is also one of the tools that can be used to convert a disk image to a virtual machine).*

## 2. PLC, IDS, SCADA Devices

To be added...

## 3. Protocols simulations

Every popular industrial protocol (e.g. Modbus, Profinet) usually have an python implementation. Just use Google to find it and configure it according to your requirements to corespond to real environment!

PS: I already wrote about **Modbus, ProfiNet, EtherNet/IP**, just check out this directory!

## Conclusions

*Using a lab is the most effective way to ensure that active penetration-testing techniques don’t affect a production network. However, you need to make sure your lab setup is a reasonable representation of the production network in terms of systems and devices used, architecture, versioning, and configuration.*
