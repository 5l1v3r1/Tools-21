## Open Source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

>AlienVault® OSSIM™, Open Source Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), provides you with a feature-rich open source SIEM complete with event collection, normalization and correlation. Launched by security engineers because of the lack of available open source products, OSSIM was created specifically to address the reality many security professionals face: A SIEM, whether it is open source or commercial, is virtually useless without the basic security controls necessary for security visibility.
>Our Open Source SIEM (OSSIM) addresses this reality by providing one unified platform with many of the essential security capabilities you need like:
> 
>     Asset discovery
>     Vulnerability assessment
>     Intrusion detection
>     Behavioral monitoring
>     SIEM event correlation
> 
> OSSIM leverages the power of the AlienVault® Open Threat Exchange® (OTX™) by allowing users to both contribute and receive real-time information about malicious hosts. In addition, we provide ongoing development for OSSIM because we believe that everyone should have access to sophisticated security technologies, to improve the security of all. From the researchers who need a platform for experimentation and the unsung heroes who can't convince their companies that security is a problem, OSSIM offers you a chance to increase security visibility and control in your network.
